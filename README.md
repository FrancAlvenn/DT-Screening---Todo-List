# DT Screening - Todo List

## Description
A simple To-Do List web app built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Users can add, mark, and delete tasks with a responsive design.

## Features
- Add tasks via button or Enter key
- Mark tasks complete (strike-through)
- Delete tasks
- Responsive UI

## Folder Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `styles.css` - CSS styles
- `script.js` - JavaScript logic
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## How I approached the Challenge
I approached the challenge by first understanding the instructions given and thinking of how should I structure the project. Since we were only asked to create a simple Todo List I focused on the core functionality of adding, marking, and deleting tasks. Only after I was finished with making the core functionality did I try to tackle the other challenges like making the UI responsive, adding theme as well as simple animations.

## Time Taken to Finish the Task
Completed within ~2 hours.


## Notes
- No external libraries used
- No persistence after refresh
- Could be extended with animations, dark mode, or drag-and-drop
